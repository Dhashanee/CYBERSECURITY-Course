# Wireless LAN or WLAN:
- It is popular way that helps to connect devices such as computer.
- In offices/homes WLAN is an alternate way of communication compared with wired LAN.
- They're cost effective and easily maintainable,no need to connect through cables,are more secure,and for unreachable places use AP(access point).
- Major issues with LAN are they're also prone to various attacks as thier counterpart wired LANs are.
- WLANs are easier to hack compared to wired LANs if not properly configured.
- Major attacks are sniffing,key cracking,DDoS(Denial of Services),D authentication attacks wardiving.

# Some main factors for securing the WLAN are:
  1. <ins>Encryption</ins>: Implement strong encryption methods like WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) that utilizes robust 128-bit ciphers. This provides a solid defense against attacks such as key cracking, sniffing, and eavesdropping.
  2. <ins>Monitoring</ins>: Set up a monitoring system to detect suspicious and unusual activities. This proactive approach can help in identifying potential threats before they penetrate your network.
  3. <ins>User Awareness and Education</ins>: Educate users on safe practices, such as the importance of changing default credentials on wireless routers. Many users tend to keep the default usernames and passwords, which makes networks vulnerable to unauthorized access.
  4. <ins>Use of Firewalls</ins>: Enable firewall features on wireless routers. Firewalls can be hardware-based (physical devices) and software-based (programs on computers) to control the traffic allowed into your network.
  5. <ins>Disable Auto-connect Features</ins>: Prevent devices from automatically connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, which can expose users to phishing attacks and rogue networks.
  6. <ins>Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Activities</ins>: When surfing sensitive websites, avoid using public and open wireless networks, as they inherently lack robust security measures.
  7. <ins>Define Security Policies</ins>: Create and apply additional security policies tailored to the specific needs of your network environment.
    
  By focusing on these factors, you can significantly enhance the security of your WLAN and protect it from various cyber threats.

# SECURE WLAN:
  wireless security depends mainly on 3 factors:
  "Encryption,Monitoring and User Awarness and Education."
# To monitor WLAN activity:
  1.Use wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS).
  2.Network monitoring
  3.Logging and analysis
  4.Setup alerts
  5.Conduct regular audits

# Some counter measures to secure Wifi at home:
  - Use most secure possible encryption,the first and most necessary step use industry-standard encryption.
  - Change default credentials,change default username and password for your router.
  - <ins>Network name (SSID) management</ins>:A less obvious SSID name can reduce the likelihood of attracting attention from potential attackers.
  - <ins>MAC address filtering</ins>: enables MAC address filtering on your router.
  - Disable auto-connect features.
  - Turn off the router when not in use.
  - Make sure you do the regular updates.
  - Disable WPS(Wifi protected setup).
  - Monitor network activites.
 
# WEP(Wired Equivalent Privacy):
  WEP uses 40 bit or 128 bit RFC for ciphers to encrypt the channel.Instead use secure protocols such as WPA 2.

# DARKWEB/DARKNET:
  - Search engines can only reach certain percentage of the internet.But they can't access the majority of websites that are hidden from normal uses.This hidden part of the internet is called dark web.
  - And its estimated to cover 90% of all websites.
  - To access deep internet you will need encryption services amd special browser like <ins>Tor,I2P or Frecnet</ins> which chooses a random path of encrypted servers also known as <ins>"nodes"</ins>.
  - Websites can also choose to not be found by search engines for various reasons.
  - But ultimately harmless websites are also found on the deep web.
  - However,many malicious contents also are there.
  - Sites like this are heavily encrypted,so tracking down the individuals behind them is extremely difficult.
  - To stay safe you need VPN and trustable antivirus software.

# Email security tips:
- You can use anonymity software,which can help hide your chosen email service from anyone who might be monitoring your internet connection.
- A good free software program to do this is <ins>Tor</ins>.
- Use spam filtetrs to block spam emails.

# PHISHING:
- is when the scammer tricks you into entering personal and financial information by pretending to be a legtimate source.
- Some cases,a phishing email can install malware on your computer,with you even entering your username and password regardless of how they obtain it.

# SPEARFISHING:
- More targeted version of the phishing scam,whereby an attacker chooses specific individuals or enterprises.
- Much more harder to detect and have better success rates if done skillfully.
- This method requires much more effort on behalf of the prepetrator and may take weeks or months to pull off.

# SMISHING:
very similar to phishing,but this social engineering scam uses SMS texts as opposed to emails and links.

# VISHING:
Another form of phishing but this time it is with voice.The social engineer will impersonate the usual services as phishing does,but this time you will have a person on the other end of the line.

# CONCLUSIONðŸ”š
- secure your smartphone.
- Human firewall is the most strongest protection against cybersecurity.
