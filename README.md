# CYBERSECURITY-Course
I successfully completed a certified Cybersecurity course on Udemy, which included multiple quizzes to reinforce learning. Throughout the course, I took detailed notes to summarize key concepts and practical knowledge. These notes serve as a valuable resource for future review and to quickly brush up on essential cybersecurity topics when needed.
